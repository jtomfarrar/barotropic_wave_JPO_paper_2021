 Some of the code needed to reproduce the results in the Journal of Physical Oceanography article "Long-distance radiation of Rossby waves from the equatorial current system" by J.T. Farrar, T.S. Durland, S.R. Jayne, and J.F. Price.  Specifically, this material should allow reproduction of Figures 2-9 and all figures in the appendices.  This code and data files were used with Matlab Version 9.6.0.1072779 (R2019a).
