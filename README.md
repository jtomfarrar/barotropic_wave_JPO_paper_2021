# barotropic_wave_JPO_paper_2021
This repository contains some of the code needed to reproduce the results in the _Journal of Physical Oceanography_ article "Long-distance radiation of Rossby waves from the equatorial current system" by J.T. Farrar, T.S. Durland, S.R. Jayne, and J.F. Price.  Specifically, this material should allow reproduction of Figures 2 and 4-9, and all figures in the appendices.  This code and data files were used with Matlab Version 9.6.0.1072779 (R2019a).

I am probably missing some dependencies, so the code may not easily run for you.  It is intended to serve as supplementary material for the paper, but I will be happy to help anyone who wants to actually run the code.  A static release of the code, made around the time of the final version of the paper, is here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4549917.  I will continue to try to fix any issues and will update the repository at https://github.com/jtomfarrar/barotropic_wave_JPO_paper_2021

The required data files are at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4541592
